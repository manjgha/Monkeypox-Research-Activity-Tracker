# Monkeypox-Research-Activity-Tracker
__________________________________________________________________________
### Problem Statement

The global response to the mpox outbreak has involved numerous research initiatives across multiple organizations, countries, and disciplines. However, stakeholders face significant challenges in tracking, coordinating, and optimizing these research efforts due to:
- Information fragmentation across various agencies and geographical locations
- Difficulty identifying research gaps and redundancies
- Insuffiecient information on project timelines and completion forecasts
- Challenges in resource allocation and prioritization of research areas
- Limited ability to coordinate international research collaboration
- Inefficient monitoring of research progress and outcomes

The "Monkeypox Research Activity Tracker" addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, comprehensive visual analytics platform that enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and coordinate mpox research activities globally.
